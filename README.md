# Restaurant Reviews App Project
In this repository you will find my solution to the Restaurant Reviews App project from Udacity's Front End Nanodegree. This project explores basic concepts regarding Javascript, Responsive Design Patterns and Accessibility by initializing and controlling the Service Worker in order to cache information for offline use, using a grid based layout and using special accessibility tags such as ```<label>```

## Requirements
* Python - Needed to serve up the site's files on your local computer. Download it on [the official Python.org website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Instructions
### How to run the app?
1. Download the folder (through ```git clonehttps://github.com/naorpeled/mws-restaurant-stage-1.git``` or by downloading the zip file through the reposity on *Github*).

2. In the folder that you've downloaded, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site's files on your local computer.
#### With Python 2.x type ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000``` in your terminal
#### With Python 3.x type ```python -m http.server 8000``` in your terminal
After executing the command above, if there aren't any errors, open this site in your web browser: http://localhost:8000

The site is working? *Great!* You're good to go. Now you can explore the site's features.

that are stored in the app's database, the other displays information about a specific restaurant.
